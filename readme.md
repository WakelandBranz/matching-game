# TechX Lyceum Matching Game

This is the first project I developed for TechX's Lyceum at UNC-Chapel Hill.  
I have never touched Javascript before this but I have messed with limited HTML so this was a very fun learning experience.  
I didn't hate Javascript as much as I initially thought I would but I have a very strong feeling that as soon as I get past the beginning stages it's gonna be hell.  

**_Notes_**
 - I heavily limited my use of AI on this; it only helped explain some of the functions I used and a bit of HTML/CSS/JavaScript syntax.
 - I referenced [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWdkt6KSirw) video for some stylistic choices and a few game logic concepts.
