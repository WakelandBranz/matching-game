# TechX Lyceum Matching Game

This is the first project I developed for TechX's Lyceum at UNC-Chapel Hill.  
I have never touched Javascript before this but I have messed with limited HTML so this was a very fun learning experience.  
I didn't hate Javascript as much as I initially thought I would but I have a very strong feeling that as soon as I get past the beginning stages it's gonna be hell.
